INTRO

This is the javascript code for a browser implementation of a neural network
password cracker.

SETUP

You will need to download and install node.js and the npm package manager and
the jq utility. You will need to build your own neural network for running the
javascript code, convert it to the correct format using the directions below.

Compiling

    Run from this directory:
    npm install
    npm run build

Testing

    Make sure that the neocortex.min.js file is copied into the examples directory.
    Run from this directory (After compiling):
    npm run test

    There are two tests: test_suite.{html,js} and guessing_curve.{html,js}

Creating a model

    This section assumes you have a trained model (weight file and architecture
    file) and configuration file from the pwd_guess.py step, and have prepared a
    guessing file.

    General steps:

    1. Serialize a model.

    In the utilities directory of this project, there is a utility to create
    a model from an architecture file and a weight file. You need to make sure
    that the utilities folder of the modified neocortex library is in your
    PYTHONPATH. See the serializer_for_js.py file for more information about
    supported options.

    serializer_for_js.py model_file weight_file ofile

    Make sure that the ofile matches the file name in worker.js and when
    deployed is in the same directory as the worker.min.js file.

    2. Create a guess number and model information file.

    This extracts information about the post processing of the neural network
    and how probabilities match guess numbers. See utils/extract_js_info.py for
    more info. This needs to be done in the training directory.

    extract_js_info.py model_config_file output_info_file.json

    extract_prob_to_gn.py ifile --ofile output_guess_number_file.json

    Combine these two files into one json file:

    jq --slurp '.[0] * .[1]' output_info_file.json output_guess_number_file.json > info_file_and_gn.json

    3. [Optional for testing] Generate test cases

    This step is if you want to run test cases in the test_suite.js file. See
    generate_js_test_cases.py for more information. Make sure that pwd_guess.py
    is in your PYTHONPATH.

    utils/generate_js_test_cases.py model_file weight_file config_file --output out_file

    This will create a JSON file that should be saved to the same location as
    the file name referenced from the test_suite.js file.

    Test cases in test_suite.js may fail, especially if you are using a
    quantized model, but should succeed for a non-quantized model.

    If you want to use the guessing_curve.{html,js} code, then you must also
    create a list of test passwords. This can be any list of passwords with one
    password per line. Use the utils/to_json.py file to convert a list of
    passwords to JSON format. Make sure that the output matches the filename in
    the guessing_curve.js file.

    4. [Optional but recommended for deployment]

    Make sure that your web server compresses the model file. Gzip or deflate
    compression are both fine and should work transparently. How to do this
    depends on the web server that is being used.

    5. [Optional but recommended for deployment]

    Quantize the javascript model so that it takes less space. See the
    quantize_json.py script for more details. This requires the json file from
    step 1.

    utils/quantize_json.py --ifile input_file_from_step1.json --ofile output_model_file.json [--bits #]

    There are other options and piping configurations to use here that can
    help. If you use a fixed point scale factor, you must edit the file from
    step 2 by hand to add the 'fixed_point_scale' key to the json object.

    6. [Optional bu recommended for deployment]

    Create a bloom filter blacklist.

    Take a list of strings to blacklist in relation to their rank in the
    blacklist. Ideally this should be a small number of passwords.

    First take the number of passwords that you want. You should use ideally
    <10^6 passwords here.

    head -n 1000000 [training data sorted by descending frequency] > first_n_passwords.txt

    Remove non-guessable passwords for the policy. E.g., for basic8:

    grep ".\{8,\}" first_n_passwords.txt > first_basic8_passwords.txt

    (Optional) Filter out passwords that the neural network will already guess
    soon. filter_probable_pwds.py is in the utils directory. You will need to
    put the first_basic8_passwords into the server side guesser before this
    step. For this step, I recommend using a tolerance of 10^3. Lower is more
    conservative but includes more passwords.

    python3 filter_probable_pwds.py first_basic8_passwords.txt [monte carlo guess numbers] --tolerance 3 > first_basic8_passwords_filtered.txt

    Create a bloom filter.

    python3 create_log_bloom_filter_list.py --ifile first_basic8_passwords_filtered.txt --ofile bloom_filter.json --json

    This will create the file [bloom_filter.json] which is a bloom filter
    containing all of the passwords in first_basic8_passwords_filtered.txt.

    This json file must be included with the info file from step 2:

    jq --slurp '.[0] * .[1]' output_from_step2.json bloom_filter.json > info_file.json

USAGE

First set up a neural network client by calling the constructor. This will
create a new thread that downloads a model and can respond to requests for guess
numbers. The argument in the constructor is a callback. This callback will be
given two arguments: a guess number and the password that the guess number
corresponds to.

To get a guess number, call the query_guess_number function on the client. This
is an asynchronous call. The guess number is returned via the callback given in
the constructor.

Minimal example of usage in javascript code:

    var client = new NeuralNetworkClient(function(guess_number, pwd) {
      // Do something with the password and guess number
      console.log(pwd + ': ' + guess_number);
    }, configuration);
    // Request a guess number for a password
    client.query_guess_number('ASDF123;!a');

An example of the value of configuration is:
{
  intermediate: "basic_3M.info_and_guess_numbers.no_bloomfilter.json",
  file: "basic_3M.weight_arch.quantized.fixed_point1000.zigzag.nospace.json",
  zigzag: true,
  scaleFactor: 300
}
